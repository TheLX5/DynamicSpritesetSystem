## Dynamic Spriteset System
This package of ASM hacks allows the users to automatically fill their VRAM area dedicated to Sprite GFX.
This whole repo still is being worked on. **Please come back later when an actual release happens or if you really want to contribute something**.

### Features
* Easy to use API, just call a routine to do the heavy work for you
* Lunar Magic's ExGFX system to store sprite graphics
* Lunar Magic's sprites showing fine regardless of the loaded ExGFX
* VRAM queue system; used to fill the VRAM at the sprite area, but it may be used for something else

### Support info
I will not provide any kind of support about this system. It's a very complex package that modifies a lot of parts of the ROM and providing support in such cases is outright impossible.

Any question I receive will most likely replied with a link to the wiki unless it's a bug report about the API or any SMW sprite I've converted.
