## Dynamic Spriteset System
This package of ASM hacks allows the users to automatically fill their VRAM area dedicated to Sprite GFX.
This whole repo still is being worked on. Please come back later when an actual release happens or if you really want to contribute something.

### Features
* Easy to use API, just call a routine to do the heavy work for you
* Lunar Magic's ExGFX system to store sprite graphics
* VRAM queue system; used to fill the VRAM at the sprite area, but it may be used for something else
* more to come later, i just wanted to prepare the repo to upload the files
